1. Project Description
- Zombie Paintball is a game based on Boxheads. It is a game where the player starts off with a pistol and as the player continues, they obtain better weapons.
The player must used the weapons to kill off waves of zombies and devils. The zombies are the basic enemy and will follow the player and attack within melee range.
The devil is a stronger enemy that will attack from far away. It will shoot projectiles rapidly once the player comes in range. The advanced weapons will include 
the shotgun (shoots multiple bullets in a spray with long reload), the rifle (shoots really fast, with low damage, and a small randomness in its spray, and the rocket
launcher (shoots really slowly, with explosive bullets that will damage zombies and players in the radius of explosion).
